# Simon Game ðŸŽ®

A browser-based version of the classic **Simon memory game**, built using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  

### Current Features
- Generates sequences of colors that the player must repeat  
- Increasing difficulty with each round  
- Simple UI with animations and sound  

### Known Issues (Work in Progress)
- Sometimes the sequence resets incorrectly after a mistake  
- Occasional delay in button animations  

Iâ€™ll be updating the project as I fix these bugs and improve the UI.
